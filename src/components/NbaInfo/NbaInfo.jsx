                    Our NBA Package is run by our in-house basketball expert. With many years of experience, they have managed to find market inefficiencies through multiple avenues in the NBA markets, providing bets that consistently beat the closing line. It's common that getting on these mispriced lines will lead to arbitrage opportunities that our members use to guarantee profits, paying off their memberships at the first opportunity.

                    With this quantifiable edge, you can be confident that the bets you place are +EV and will lead to long term profitability. Starting in February 2023, our NBA Package has reached an impressive milestone, exceeding 100+ units by the close of the regular season. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that last season's performance only provides a partial perspective.

                    Please note, our NBA Package is only valid for the pre-season, regular season and awards. Playoffs will not be tipped.
